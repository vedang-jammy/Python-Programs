1. Functions are inside
modules inside the
standard library.
eg. 
from os import getcwd
here , getcwd is function inside OS module and its from standard library.

2. 'in' operator :
   The in operator checks if one thing is inside another. It returns either True or False
   eg. if x in y

3.Instead of referring
to a code “block,”
Python programmers
use the word “suite.”
Both names are used
in practice, but the
Python docs prefer
“suite.” 

4.Mutable: the thing is mutable if you can change that thing at any time by adding,
removing, or changing objects.
eg. list

5. .join() function:
we can use this to convert range of list into the string.
eg. list = ['a','e','i','o','u']
print(''.join(list))
output -> aeiou

6. continue :
This keyword is used to stop the loop and go back to start of the loop again.

7. 'is' and 'is not' operators:
used in place of == operator .
it checks types and value at the same time.
so if 0 == 0,0 is true but 
if 0 is 0.0 is false coz this are of different types.
use only for None type or boolean type.
eg.i f number is None:
